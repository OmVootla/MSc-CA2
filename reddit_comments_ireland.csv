"I've filled out the form. What I would do is;

1. Vacant Land Tax
2. Expand Critical Skills Visa to include trades to entice more tradespeople to work in the country.
3. Concentrate on Low Rise (5-7 Story) Appartment building in city centre locations. This will reduce the sprall of building outward and maintain the existing natural state of Irelands Green Fields. This will also free up Houses currently being shared by individuals who will likely be more enticed by appartment living.
4. Restrict the ability to object to Planning Permission. 
5. The greater Need for Housing should override individual concerns for Planning Ojections and Decision by An Board Planala.

I honestly feel that while this won't do anyone any good in the short to medium term. This is the best long-term strategy",IronicallyBad90,28,28,0

This consultation is being carried on behalf of the Housing Commission. The purpose of the consultation is to inform the Housing Commission’s consideration of long-term housing policy post 2030. It is also looking at current housing issues that could affect the long-term.

The Commission is seeking specific views on each of the following areas:

* maintaining a long-term sustainable housing supply and providing balance and choice of tenures
* the cost and quality of housing, including the drivers of cost
* the capacity of the construction sector to meet housing supply requirements
* the affordability of private rental accommodation
* the affordability of house purchasing for first-time buyers
* rural housing
* regulation of social housing
* the role of Approved Housing Bodies in housing provision",bigvalen,8,8,0

We need greater Dublin city to look more like Barcelona with blocks of apartments and scattered parks and metros. The city centre can stay the same but start a big plan to turn the suburbs into blocks of medium rise. Build a new high rise neighbourhood to for a new CBD. Link them all with a metro.

"1. Change to a more consistent zonal planning system
2. Make planning about appropriate building structure and not who is building (no local needs)
3. Include alternative building methods in the approved builders group that builders have to be in so you can get modular builds insured when applying for a mortgage
4. Make the definition of an affordable house the central bank mortgage lending limit (3.5x) multiplied by the 33rd percentile national income plus 10% (for the required deposit).
5. Planning permission only granted for multi unit developments if they have at least one third of each class (2 bed, 3 bed, 4 bed) for sale at affordable prices to means tested buyers ... OR govt/councils engage builders directly to provide affordable housing per definition 
6. No more large estates full of cul de sacs. Planning permission only if estates allow passthrough traffic on streets (not stroads), and provide public transport links into and through the estates. This will hopefully make estates out of the city more appealing with easier commutes and greater walkability

"I don't have any single answer but I've got a few suggestions.

Firstly I would come up with some kind of local demand test which would determine if there were people looking to buy properties in which they will actually live in within a given area and where the supply was not meeting demand. If that was the case then  a quota would be set for the number of properties that can be bought in that areas for investment purposes.

I'd also overhaul the planning system to make it easier to build high density housing. I'd reduce the amount of weight given to objections when decisions are made and also require them to prove (at their expense) any negative effects they claim they will suffer if the application was granted.

I'd establish easy planning zones away from the sticks but close to motorways and railway lines. These would be areas where planning applications could only be turned down if it was showen that the designs were bad or unsafe. So basically a developer could say I want to build 50 houses here and so long as the design of the houses was ok and and things like rods and utilities were taken care of then the application would be waved through.

I'd also seek to introduce a constitutional change requiring TDs to be only TDs. You would have to give up any business interests you have before you could take your seat. It doesn't matter how many good ideas there are to fix the housing crisis, nothing will change when a huge chunk of our TDs are looking after their own financial interests.",TheSameButBetter,2,2,0

"Construction is one of the most heavily taxed economic activities in Ireland, between VAT on new residential properties, development levies, and all the other taxes that every business has to pay. It’s basic economics that if you tax something heavily less of it will be produced, and it’s a fact that even if land was sourced at its agricultural value the high cost of construction in Ireland plus taxes would still put purchase of new homes beyond the economic reach of a large share of the population.

"I am a bit late to the party here and this will probably be buried in the responses but I have a bit of a different take to most.

Make buying property less of an attractive investing option.

At the moment investing options in Ireland are limited. EFTs charge over 50% on earnings and DIRT is higher compared to most countries. When you’ve already maxed out your pension the only real legitimate investing option left is property. It’s a low risk with a relative guarantee of a decent ROI. 

I think if you open up other investment options such as reducing the tax on EFTs while simultaneously increasing the tax on rental properties / vacant properties it would shift the market focus and more landlords would leave the market freeing up accommodation for purchase / rent.
