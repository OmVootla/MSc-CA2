"The only solution is for renters or locked out buyers to never vote labor or liberal again. These parties have no incentive, and will never have an incentive, to solve this problem.

Political parties in this country serve only one purpose: their own electability and the well-being of their donors.

This matters federal, state and locally. Nothing else will move the needle. And i bet as soon as one of us battlers ends up owning, we’ll immediately abandon the righteous path and start voting for the party that keeps our investment growing.

The current problem is now due to a construction industry that has been pushed to the limit of building capacity, there are major projects all over Australia and housing in huge demand that tradies are spoilt for choice.  

And for companies collapsing it is because contracts have been locked in from the initial Covid stage of investment and now we are dealing with huge inflation in building costs, probably averaging 40% rise for most materials, which is not only from the huge demand for material but also supply lines being disrupted globally. The last point has settled slightly but we’re still feeling the affects.

There are plenty of young people currently living at home with their parents who are using negative gearing to hopefully one day be able to afford the house they bought but can't afford to live in.

The problem is that you can leverage negative gearing from several properties to avoid paying tax, which is something many very wealthy people do. Capping the amount you can reduce your taxable income is a way more sensible choice - a cap of only being able to reduce your taxable income by 20 grand or so would prevent the systematic abuse while still allowing the younger generation to have an easier time of getting a foot into the property market.

Over time you might be able to remove negative gearing entirely - clicking your fingers and removing it now, particularly with the current economic pressures would pop the housing bubble and decimate property prices (which would hurt all home owners and the carry on effect would also probably be felt by renters).",Wonderor,18,18,0

Vienna has significantly stopped the construction of public housing because it makes private housing unviable. Why buy private housing when customers can wait for public housing? We had public housing programs for veterans when there were widespread unemployment and land was plentiful in outskirts of cities.

On top of all this, Australia's residential construction codes are far more stringent than back in 50s or 60s with each states overlaying with planning and design requirements like NSW SEPP65 and BASIX standards.
